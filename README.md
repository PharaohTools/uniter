Uniter
======

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/asmblah/uniter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/asmblah/uniter)

Uniter is a recompiling interpreter written in JavaScript.

Can I try it now?
-----------------

[Sure you can](http://asmblah.github.io/uniter/demo/interactive.html).

Running the tests
-----------------

There are two supported ways of running the Mocha test suite:

1. Run the tests in Node.js from the command line:

        cd uniter/
        npm test

2. Run the tests in a browser by starting a Node.js server:

        npm run-script webtest

   You should then be able to run the tests by visiting http://127.0.0.1:6700 in a supported web browser.
